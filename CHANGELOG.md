## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add `rvow init`, `rvow new` and `rvow validate` to create the rvow tree, plan a change and check it.
- Add `rvow accept` to run the baseline and record the plan as the vow.
- Add `rvow prove` to run a task's stored verify command and record the proof, and `rvow status` and `rvow gate` to show where the branch stands.
- Add drift detection for plan edits made after accept.
  Record each edit with `rvow amend` and let the user decide with `rvow confirm`.
- Add `rvow block` to report a task that cannot pass as written, and `rvow note` to leave decisions and handoffs.
- Add `rvow check`, `rvow clarify`, `rvow answer`, `rvow review` and `rvow claim` to prepare a plan before accept.
- Add `rvow archive`, `rvow drop` and `rvow supersede` to close a change, and `rvow trace` to list the changes that touched a requirement.
- Add `rvow ls`, `rvow show`, `rvow path`, `rvow spec` and `rvow guide` to read plans, specs and the writing guides.
- Add `rvow import openspec` to convert an OpenSpec tree into specs and backlog changes.
- Add `rvow rebind` to record a repository's roots and remote in its rvow tree, and to move a home tree to the path its remote implies.
- Add `rvow install` to set up the skill, the Claude Code mod, the pi extension and the pre-push gate.
- Add a Claude Code mod with a plan pane, a needs-you band, `/rvow-status` and `/rvow-review`, and a pi extension with a widget.
- Print TOON for agents when stdout is not a terminal, with help lines and explicit empty states.
  Use `--human` or `--toon` to choose.
